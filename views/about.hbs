    <p class="content">
        For this project we propose an SFU-focused webservice to facilitate the return of lost belongings found on
        campus.
        A common experience of many SFU students is either losing an item or finding an item at school. The common
        response is to
        post about it on social media, whether it be on one of the many SFU related Facebook groups, a hopeful tweet to
        your
        followers, or to simply ask around. Seasoned students, however, know that social media blasts often are not
        effective
        and just result in comments suggesting “give it to security”. There are several problems with this, such as not
        being
        in the same social networks, not using social media at all, or circumventing the lost and found system
        altogether and
        going straight to security. To solve these problems, we want to build an SFU purpose-built webservice to connect
        finders, losers, and the 3 Campus Security desks.

        SFU Security maintains a database of lost and found items, but it is only for Burnaby campus.
        You can email or call security about items, but only for the Burnaby or Vancouver campuses.
        You can visit the security desk, but only at Surrey and Vancouver campus. Burnaby asks you to call before
        emailing, while Vancouver doesn’t mind either option, but calls go to security and emails go to Facilities
        Services.
        We want our project to change this mess of touchpoints and unify the school’s process for lost and found items.
