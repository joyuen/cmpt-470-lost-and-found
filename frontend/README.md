# Setup

1. Install Angular CLI ([github](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli), [website](https://cli.angular.io/)): `npm install -g @angular/cli`
2. run `npm install` (will create a `node_modules/` folder)
3. run `ng serve` to start the server (or `npm start`)
4. Server will be hosted on `http://localhost:4200/`
(`ng serve` automatically restarts on updates)

The Angular webpage is in the `src` folder, check the [angular docs](https://angular.io/start) for more info on components, routing, xscsdcx however you need to modify it
