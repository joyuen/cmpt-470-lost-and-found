# LostAndFound

The project is split into two servers:
   * `frontend` - webpages, web server stuff, sends requests to the backend server to get user data and stuff
   * `backend` - internal webserver, manages MongoDB, reveals an API for the frontend server to use

Both servers need to be running (frontend communicates with the backend). Check the `README` in each folder to see how to get each server running. (currently backend is under construction)
