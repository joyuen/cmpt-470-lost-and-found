                    <p>
                        For this project we propose an SFU-focused webservice to facilitate the return of lost belongings found on campus.
                        A common experience of many SFU students is either losing an item or finding an item at school. The common response is to
                        post about it on social media, whether it be on one of the many SFU related Facebook groups, a hopeful tweet to your
                        followers, or to simply ask around. Seasoned students, however, know that social media blasts often are not effective
                        and just result in comments suggesting “give it to security”. There are several problems with this, such as not being
                        in the same social networks, not using social media at all, or circumventing the lost and found system altogether and
                        going straight to security. To solve these problems, we want to build an SFU purpose-built webservice to connect
                        finders, losers, and the 3 Campus Security desks.

                        SFU Security maintains a database of lost and found items, but it is only for Burnaby campus.
                        You can email or call security about items, but only for the Burnaby or Vancouver campuses.
                        You can visit the security desk, but only at Surrey and Vancouver campus. Burnaby asks you to call before
                        emailing, while Vancouver doesn’t mind either option, but calls go to security and emails go to Facilities Services.
                        We want our project to change this mess of touchpoints and unify the school’s process for lost and found items.
